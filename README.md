# online-eCommerce-Auction-Application-

This e-Commerce website project is designed to provide a platform for online buying and selling. The core framework used for development is Struts2.

The website operates as a web-based application, hosted on a Tomcat web server and featuring an HTML/JSP frontend. This approach allows for a dynamic and interactive user interface, making it user-friendly. The project relies on a MySQL relational database to store and manage data efficiently, ensuring seamless retrieval and storage of user profiles, items for sale, bids, and other critical information.

The required system functionality includes user registration and login, both of which employ session management for security and personalization. Users are greeted with a personalized "Logged in as [username]" message at the top of each page because of the session-based user identification. The system also offers features such as viewing user profiles, adding items for sale, making bids, and managing bids effectively. Overall, this e-Commerce website leverages Struts2, HTML/JSP, Tomcat, and MySQL to deliver a platform for online shopping and trading.
